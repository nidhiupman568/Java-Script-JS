readFile(path, options, callback);
```
- To write a file:
```javascript
writeFile(path, data, callback);
```

### 24. Variable Typing in JavaScript
**Question:** What is variable typing in JavaScript?

**Solution:** Variable typing allows a variable to store different types of values. For example:
```javascript
let geeks = 42;
geeks = "GeeksforGeeks";
```

### 25. Converting Strings to Integers
**Question:** How do you convert a string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?

**Solution:** Use the `parseInt()` function, which takes the string and the base as arguments. If the string doesn't contain a number, it returns NaN.
```javascript
let number = parseInt("1010", 2); // Converts binary 1010 to integer 10
```

### 26. Detecting the Client's Operating System

- **Confirmation box:** Has OK and Cancel buttons, allowing the user to agree or cancel.

### 29. Disadvantages of Using innerHTML
**Question:** What are the disadvantages of using `innerHTML` in JavaScript?

**Solution:** Using `innerHTML` can replace the content entirely, which can remove event handlers attached to DOM elements. Using `+=` to append also replaces the old content.

### 30. Use of void(0) in JavaScript
**Question:** What is the use of `void(0)` in JavaScript?

**Solution:** `void(0)` is used to call a function without refreshing the page. It effectively does nothing and returns `undefined`.

### 31. 'Strict' Mode in JavaScript
**Question:** What is 'Strict' mode in JavaScript and how can it be enabled?

**Solution:** 'Strict' mode is a feature in ECMAScript 5 that makes JavaScript code run in a restricted mode, throwing more exceptions to prevent errors. It can be enabled by adding `"use strict";` at the beginning of a script or function.
```javascript
"use strict";
```

### 32. Getting the Status of a CheckBox
**Question:** How can you get the status of a checkbox in JavaScript?

**Solution:** Use the `checked` property of the checkbox element.
```javascript
let isChecked = document.getElementById("GFG").checked; // Returns true if checked
```

### 33. Understanding Closures in JavaScript
**Question:** What are closures in JavaScript and when are they used?

**Solution:** Closures are created when a function retains access to its parent scope, even after the parent function has finished executing. They provide better control over code.
```javascript
function foo() {
    let b = 1;
    function inner() {
        return b;
    }
    return inner;
}
let get_func_inner = foo();
console.log(get_func_inner()); // Outputs 1
```

### 34. Difference Between call() and apply() Methods
**Question:** What is the difference between `call()` and `apply()` methods in JavaScript?

**Solution:**
- **call() method:** Invokes a function with a specified `this` value and arguments provided individually.
- **apply() method:** Invokes a function with a specified `this` value and arguments provided as an array.

### 35. Targeting a Particular Frame with a Hyperlink
**Question:** How can you target a particular frame from a hyperlink in JavaScript?

**Solution:** Use the `target` attribute in the hyperlink.
```html
<a href="/geeksforgeeks.htm" target="newframe">New Page</a>
```

### 36. Types of Errors in JavaScript
**Question:** What are the types of errors shown in JavaScript?

**Solution:**
